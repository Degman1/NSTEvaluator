# Breaking the Animation Bottleneck: Evaluating Neural Style Transfer for Multi-Style Scalability in Creative Film Production

Critical obstacles of animation films, such as ”Spider-
Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” include time and labor-
intensive production, high computational resource cost, vi-
sual identity standardization, and multi-style project scala-
bility. To evaluate the application of neural style transfer
to animation production, Linear Style Transfer, Arbitrary
Style Transfer via Multi-Adaptation Network, and Style In-
jection in Diffusion are analyzed according to the follow-
ing metrics: Art-Fid, Structural Similarity Index Measure,
color similarity, content loss, style loss, inference time, and
a novel Animation Score. Animation Score combines ob-
jective analysis with subjective production priorities. Four
experiments, conducted with a specialized scalable evalu-
ation framework, wholistically evaluate the models: origi-
nal comic style transfer, AI-generated pattern style transfer,
emotion style transfer, and consecutive frame analysis. The
diffusion model generates the highest quality output com-
pared to the other models at the expense of inference effi-
ciency. With a careful curation of style images, each style
transfer method, exhibiting distinct trade-offs, serves as an
innovative tool that facilitates efficient animation creativity.
